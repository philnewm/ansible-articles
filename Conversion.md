Obsidian supports a bunch of features which aren't supported on Dev.to and probably medium as well.
I will need to either remove the special formatting in an automated way before pushing updates to these sites or find a way to convert them - maybe html can help here.


## Github Pages

* Research the kind of markdown formatting supported on Github pages
## Dev.to
* Figure out what kinda formatting i supported on Dev.to
